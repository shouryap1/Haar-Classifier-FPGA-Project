# Implementation of Inference of Haar Classifier using FPGA
This project implements the Inference Architecture of Haar Cascade given in paper ["FPGA-Based Face Detection System Using Haar Classifiers"](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jkoberg/pubs/fpga09-face_detection.pdf) in the Basys 3 FPGA Board. This was done as part of the "System design with FPGA" course. A report of the work is also attached for further details of implementation.

Different Vivado Projects in the Repository: <br>
Project-1 : Built a single stage architecture <br>
Project-2 : Simulates a Multistage Haar Cascade Classifier <br>
Project-3 : Implemented the inference of a Multistage Haar Cascade Classifier on the Basys 3 FPGA <br>
Project-4 : Implemented the inference of a Multistage Haar Cascade Classifier on the Basys 3 FPGA along with a master reset to stop the design <br>
